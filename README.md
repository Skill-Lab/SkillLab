# Skill Lab

Our project, Skill Lab, is an online learning and networking platform that aims to connect users over shared interests or skills. By providing a web application where users can ask and answer questions in interest-specific subspaces, and become mentors, Skill Lab offers necessary guidance and accountability for all. After successfully creating our vision for this project, we expect Skill Lab to bridge the gap between professionals, students, experts, and novices in an online community. 

## Code Structure

Under the `client/skill_lab/src folder`, the code structure is broken down as follows:

- `components`: This is where all the reusable components are stored 
- `domain`: This is where all routes for each components are stored 
- `store`: All the redux reducers are stored within this folder
- `firebase.js`: This is where firebase is instantiated retrieving the api key from .env.local file
- `index.css`: Application styling
- `index.js`: Root file that renders the entire app
